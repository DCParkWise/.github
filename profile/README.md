**Smart, Street-Level Parking Intelligence for Washington, D.C.**

 DCParkWise – Smarter Street Parking in DC
DCParkWise is a real-time street parking map built to help Uber drivers, DoorDash drivers, and local students find free curbside parking in Washington, D.C.
Instead of wasting money on metered zones or risking parking tickets, users can see when and where free parking is available — block-by-block, with exact days and time ranges.

**Inspiration**
Many short-term drivers — especially Uber Eats, DoorDashers, and students renting cars — get parking tickets just for stopping 2 minutes at the curb.
Even when free parking is available nearby, they don't know where or when.
We built DCParkWise to help them save money, avoid stress, and park smarter.

**Future Vision **
Goal: Integrate with Google Maps or evolve like SpotAngels — but smarter.

DCParkWise shows street-level free parking zones with precise time ranges — SpotAngels does not.

Plan to add crowdsourced reviews and updates:

Users can verify or update timings (e.g., holidays like July 4th).

After 2–3 confirmations, the map reflects new info.

**Key Difference**
Unlike SpotAngels and other apps, DCParkWise tells you exactly:

Which streets are free

What time and which days

And when towing or tickets apply

Whether you're new to the city, a daily commuter, or just running errands downtown, DCParkWise helps you quickly identify where you can legally park and when it's free.

## 🚀 What We're Building

###  Core Features

##  How It Works

1. **🗺 Google Maps API**  
   We use Google Maps to power the interactive map and geolocation features for precision street-level data.

2. **📊 Parking Rule Dataset**  
   Our backend parses D.C.’s open data sources (e.g., DDOT, DMPED) and overlays them with curated rule-sets for each street segment.

3. **⏱ Time-Aware Logic**  
   Our system cross-references the user's current or future time selection with D.C.'s local parking restrictions, identifying safe, legal parking zones in real time.

4. **📍Frontend UI**  
   Built with React.js and Tailwind CSS, our interface is designed to be intuitive, mobile-responsive, and focused on clarity—showing exactly what you need to know, when you need to know it.

5. **☁️ Hosting & Infra**  
   The app is hosted on Vercel for seamless CI/CD and low-latency global access. Our backend services use Node.js and Firebase (with plans to migrate to Supabase for scale).

## 💡 Why We’re Building This

Parking in D.C. is chaotic—and for people who live and work in the city, it's more than just an inconvenience. We've spoken with Uber and delivery drivers who receive multiple parking tickets per month simply for stopping in the wrong zone at the wrong time. Students near Georgetown, GWU, Howard, American, and UMD often feel overwhelmed trying to find parking late at night—only to end up ticketed or towed.

The irony? **Many D.C. streets allow free parking after 9 PM**, but almost no one knows where or how to check. There’s no single, accessible tool that explains those rules clearly in real time. That’s why we built **DCParkWise**: to decode the street signs, surface the hidden free zones, and help anyone—from students to gig workers—park smarter and stress-free.

## 👥 Who’s Behind This
DCParkWise is being developed by a group of passionate technologists and urban problem-solvers based in Washington, D.C.—led by [Sameer Shaik](https://www.sameer-shaik.com), a recent Computer Science graduate from GWU who’s been on both sides of the parking struggle.

## 📈 Future Plans
- iOS/Android support (PWA or native)
- Real-time parking availability (via sensors or community input)
- Ticket prediction risk scores
- Integration with Waze or Google Maps routing
- AI-based parking recommendation system
