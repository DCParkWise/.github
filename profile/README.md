# DCParkWise 🅿  
**Smart, Street-Level Parking Intelligence for Washington, D.C.**

## Overview
DCParkWise is a real-time, rule-aware parking assistant built specifically for Washington, D.C. It helps users find free and paid parking on D.C. streets based on time, zone, and local regulations—so you can park confidently without second-guessing signs, risking tickets, or circling the block for hours.

Whether you're new to the city, a daily commuter, or just running errands downtown, DCParkWise helps you quickly identify where you can legally park and when it's free.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **🗺 Google Maps API**  
   We use Google Maps to power the interactive map and geolocation features for precision street-level data.

2. **📊 Parking Rule Dataset**  
   Our backend parses D.C.’s open data sources (e.g., DDOT, DMPED) and overlays them with curated rule-sets for each street segment.

3. **⏱ Time-Aware Logic**  
   Our system cross-references the user's current or future time selection with D.C.'s local parking restrictions, identifying safe, legal parking zones in real time.

4. **📍Frontend UI**  
   Built with React.js and Tailwind CSS, our interface is designed to be intuitive, mobile-responsive, and focused on clarity—showing exactly what you need to know, when you need to know it.

5. **☁️ Hosting & Infra**  
   The app is hosted on Vercel for seamless CI/CD and low-latency global access. Our backend services use Node.js and Firebase (with plans to migrate to Supabase for scale).

## 💡 Why We’re Building This

Parking in D.C. is chaotic—and for people who live and work in the city, it's more than just an inconvenience. We've spoken with Uber and delivery drivers who receive multiple parking tickets per month simply for stopping in the wrong zone at the wrong time. Students near Georgetown, GWU, Howard, American, and UMD often feel overwhelmed trying to find parking late at night—only to end up ticketed or towed.

The irony? **Many D.C. streets allow free parking after 9 PM**, but almost no one knows where or how to check. There’s no single, accessible tool that explains those rules clearly in real time. That’s why we built **DCParkWise**: to decode the street signs, surface the hidden free zones, and help anyone—from students to gig workers—park smarter and stress-free.
